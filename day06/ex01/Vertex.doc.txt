<- Vertex ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Define a point with color and texture coordinates.

A vertex is an improved point.

It has a position and other extra attributes that will be used for drawing: 
in SFML, vertices also have a color and a pair of texture coordinates.

The vertex is the building block of drawing. Everything which is visible on 
screen is made of vertices. They are grouped as 2D primitives 
(triangles, quads, ...), and these primitives are grouped to create even more 
complex 2D entities such as sprites, texts, etc.

If you use the graphical entities of SFML (sprite, text, shape) you won't 
have to deal with vertices directly. But if you want to define your own 2D 
entities, such as tiled maps or particle systems, using vertices will allow 
you to get maximum performances.


The Vertex class handles the representation of a point in space.

An instance can be contructed from an array of the following consecutive
parameters: an X axis coordinate, Y axis coordinate, Z depth coordinate
optionally a homogenous W coordinate and an RGB Color (Color class):
new Vertex( [ x=1.00, y=1.00, z=1.00, w=1.00, new Color([red=255, green=255, blue=255]) ] );

X, Y, Z, W as well as Red, green, blue constitutives and RGB values are
converted to intergers. Negative or > to 255 color constitutives are left
as is. Any other use is undefined behaviour.

The class provides no methods.
